This repo contains examples of different IaC approaches for network segmentation in Azure. In Azure there are two main technologies to separate workloads from each other:

- Azure Firewall
  - Network rules
  - Application rules
- Network Security Groups
  - IP-based
  - Application Security Groups (a sort of label assigned to the NIC's IP configuration)
